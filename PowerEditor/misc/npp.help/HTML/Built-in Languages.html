<h1>Built-in languages</h1>
<p>Standard
Notepad++ comes preloaded with a list with some of the most popular
languages. You can select those languages using the Language
menu&nbsp;and configure their style using the <a href="Styler%20Configurator.html">Styler Configurator</a>. Most
often the correct language is selected when opening a file based on the
extension or filename (as is the case for makefiles) but you can always
select another one. When saving a session, the selected language will
be remembered, but closing and reopening the file will trigger the
autodetection again. You can change the extensions that are associated
with a language using the <a href="Styler%20Configurator.html#Extension">Styler Configurator</a>.
