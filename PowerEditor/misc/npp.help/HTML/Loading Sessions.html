<body><h1>Loading sessions</h1>
<p>To load a session, simply go to
<span class="menu_item">File-&gt;Load Session</span>. Then select any session you like and it will
open the files contained in it, and restore their state.
<p>If you have
set a default session extension (for example, .session) for Notepad++,
you can also open a session using the regular means to open a file. If
the file has the extension for a session, Notepad++ will attempt to
load it (see also the section for <a href="Preferences.html#MISC">Preferences</a>
<p>Depending if you have set a default extension for session files, you can filter for those files in the Load Session dialog.
