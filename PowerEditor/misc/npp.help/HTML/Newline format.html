<h1>Newline format</h1>
<p>Files
that have multiple lines of text have special newline characters to
indicate where one line ends and a new one begins. Because operating systems have had 
different traditional formats, Notepad++ and Scintilla have support to handle and 
them. When editing a file, Notepad++ will try to determine the
newline format used and base any newline operations on that. To
change the format used, simple select it from the Format menu. All
newlines will be changed and subsequent newlines added will be of
this format.
