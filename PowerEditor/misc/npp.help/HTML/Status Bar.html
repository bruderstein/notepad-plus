<h1>Status
Bar</h1>
<p>The
status bar shows additional information about the currently active
document and consists of six sections.
<p><ul><li>The first section shows the current language that is
selected for that document (see <a href="Languages.html">Languages</a>). 
</li><li>The
second section shows the amount of characters (in bytes) that the
current document contains. This is not equal to the filesize of the
document (except for ANSI documents), but the internal size (see
<a href="Encoding.html">Encoding</a> for more details).
</li><li>After
that you find information about the cursor in the document. It
consists of the current line ('Ln', first line is line 1), the
current column ('Col', first position is 1) and the length of the
selection (in bytes, see&nbsp;<a href="Encoding.html">Encoding</a>). If you <span class="shortcut">doubleclick</span> on this
section, the <a href="Go%20to%20dialog.html">Go to Line dialog</a> will pop up.
</li><li>The
fourth section shows the current newline format (see <a href="Newline%20format.html">Newline format</a></a>).
</li><li>The
fifth section shows the current character encoding of the document
(see&nbsp;<a href="Encoding.html">Encoding</a>).
</li><li>The
sixth and last section shows the current overtype status of the
active view. INS means insertion and OVR means overtype (see <a href="Overtype.html">Overtype</a>
for more information). Clicking on this section switches between insertion and  overtype typing mode.
</li></ul>
