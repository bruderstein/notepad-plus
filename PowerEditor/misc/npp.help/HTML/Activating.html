<h1>Activating
a file:</h1>
<p>Notepad++
allows you to open multiple files at once, or multiple files multiple times, but only one will be
active (have focus) at any time. All files are represented on the tab
bar with their filename and an icon indicating if its normal, edited
or readonly (see the section about the Tab Bar for more details).
Simply click on a tab to activate the file. You can also use the
<span class="shortcut">Ctrl-TAB</span> and <span class="shortcut">Ctrl-Shift-TAB</span> key combinations to switch through the
active files, or depress the right mouse button and use the scroll
wheel (see also <a href="Switching%20between%20Documents.html">Switching between Documents</a>).<p>
If
you have Multi-View enabled, only one view can be actually active,
however you can see both files (see also the section about
<a href="Multi%20View.html">Multi-View</a>).
