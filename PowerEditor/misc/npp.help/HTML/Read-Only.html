<h1>
<p>Read-only
files:</h1>
<p>Documents in Notepad++ can be marked as read-only, meaning
they cannot be modified.
<p>
Notepad++
recognizes two read-only states:
<p><ul><li>The file in the filesystem is
marked as read-only. You can only enable the editing of the file by
clearing the read-only flag. You can do so by selecting <span class="menu_item">Edit-&gt;Clear
Read Only Flag</span>.
</li><li>The
document in Notepad++ is marked as read-only. You can manually set
this option by selecting <span class="menu_item">Edit-&gt;Set Read Only</span>. The document in
Notepad++ cannot be edited, but if the file exists in the filesystem
it will not be marked as read-only, this is just an internal state.</li></ul>
