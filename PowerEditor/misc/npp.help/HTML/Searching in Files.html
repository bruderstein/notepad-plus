<h1>Searching in Files</h1>
<p><img style="width: 488px; height: 318px;" alt="" src="Images/Screenshots/fif.png"><p>The
<span class="label">Find in Files</span> dialog searches for matches in all the files that are
specified by the given filters. 
<p>The <span class="label">Filters</span> input allows you to
filter be name and extension, and is a space separated list. It will
automatically use the extensions associated with the language of the
currently opened file, but can easily be overridden (see <a href="Languages.html">Languages</a>).
<p>The <span class="label">Directory</span> field will allow you to fill in the directory to
search, and by default is the directory of the active file (for more
info, see <a href="Preferences.html#New_Document_Open_Save_directory">Preferences</a>).
<p>Whether the filter and search directory conform to the current document or remain what they are unless user decides otherwise is controlled by the <span class="checkbox">Follow doc</span> checkbox.
<p>
When
<span class="checkbox">In all sub-folders</span> is checked, additionally all sub-directories are
scanned for search results as well. When <span class="checkbox">In hidden folders</span> is checked,
hidden sub-directories will also be checked (by default, these will
be skipped). <span class="button">Find them all</span>&nbsp;will initiate the search.

Results are displayed in the <a href="Search%20window.html">Search results window</a>
