<h1>Search result window</h1>
<p>
<img src="Images\Screenshots\srwindow.png">
<p>The
results of most searches that can return several hits will be displayed in a dockable panel (see
<a href="Dockable%20Windows.html">Dockable Windows</a> for more information). The results will be sorted on
a per file and per line basis, and can be collapsed for each file (by&nbsp;<span class="shortcut">doubleclicking</span> the filename) (also see <a href="Folding.html">Folding</a>).
<p>
Commands that make use of the facility are:<p>
<ul><li><span class="button">Find all in all opened documents</span> in <a href="Normal%20Search.html">Find dialog</a>
</li><li><span class="button">Find all in current documents</span> in <a href="Searching.html">Find dialog</a>
</li><li><span class="button">Find them all</span> in <a href="Searching%20in%20files.html">Find in files dialog</a>
</li></ul>

<p>The results in the Search results window can be deleted using the DEL key, on an individual, per file or per search basis. They can be
 further manipulated using the right click popup menu for the window. Additionally, the text of the window is plain text that can be copied
 and asted for further processing. <span class="shortcut">Doubleclicking</span> on a result will open that file and go to its
location.

<p><span class="menu_item">Search-&gt;Switch to found results window</span> shows this window if hidden and not empty, and toggles focus between 
it and the main Notepad++ window. When the window is not shown, <span class="menu_item">Go to Next found result</span> and <span class="menu_item">Go to Previous found result</span> navigate among results. 
On earlier versions of Notepad++, the three menu entries are not there, and the names may not show on the Shortcut mapper. Default key bindings are F7, F4 and Shift+F4 respectively).

<p>
The
results will be colored depending on the type of result. See &nbsp;<a href="Styler%20Configurator.html#Search_result">Styler Configurator</a> for information on how to change these
colors.
