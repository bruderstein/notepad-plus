<h1>Folding</h1>
<p>Notepad++
supports so called folding for your text documents. This means that
certain lines of your text can be hidden based on certain traits.
This works well for structured languages such as C++ or XML . Blocks
of texts are 'parented' to others and by folding them (also called
collapsing) only the first line is visible. This works well if you
want a quick glance at your document and skim for a relevant
position. Unfolding the text (a.k.a. Expanding or Uncollapsing) shows the text again.
<p>
You can recognize text that can be folded by looking at the fold
margin on the left. This margin shows icons and line to indicate the
structure of the text (the appearance of the margin can be changed,
see&nbsp;<a href="Styler%20Configurator.html#Fold">Styler Configurator</a> and <a href="Preferences.html#Edit_Components">Preferences</a>).
The current lexer determines the structure (see <a href="Languages.html">Languages</a>). By
default, the fold margin shows boxes and lines to indicate the
structure. A box with a minus sign (<img style="width: 12px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="Images/fold_min.png">) indicates the text can be
collapsed. Inversely, a box with a plus sign (<img style="width: 12px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="Images/fold_plus.png">) indicates the text
can be expanded. Folded text is additionally indicated with a
horizontal line where the text is collapsed. The first line of the
collapsed text will always remain visible. Lines on the fold margin
indicate that the textlines they run by are foldable. Vertical lines
(<img style="width: 8px; height: 14px;" alt="" src="Images/fold_line.png">) indicate multiple lines that can be folded together as a group,
which is terminated with a small horizontal line(<img style="width: 9px; height: 15px;" alt="" src="Images/fold_bar.png">) or a box.
<p>There
are multiple ways to <span style="font-weight: bold;">fold</span> text.
<p ><ul><li><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The
foremost means is by clicking with the <span class="shortcut">left mouse button</span> on a box
with a minus sign. This will simply collapse all the text that is in
this group.</font>
</li><li><font face="Times New Roman, serif">The
same procedure but with the <span class="shortcut">Ctrl</span> key pressed down will cause the
group to collapse, but also any sub groups inside. This effectively
means that if you were to unfold just that group, all subgroups would
still be folded.</font>
</li><li><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Using
the menu:<br></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><span class="menu_item">View-&gt;Fold
All</span> will fold every single group in the document, causing the minimal
amount of text visible.</font>
<span class="menu_item">View-&gt;Collapse
current level</span> will only collapse the current group (that is, the
group that contains the current line, anywhere in the group). This
will not collapse any subgroups.</font>
<span class="menu_item">View-&gt;Collapse
level...</span> will collapse the selected level (ranging from 1 to 8).
This will collapse all the groups on a particular level, but not any
subgroups. You can use this to view your text with a certain 'level
of detail'.</font>
</li></ul><font face="Times New Roman, serif">To
<span style="font-weight: bold;">unfold</span> folded text, use any of the following measures:</font>
p><ul><li><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Click
on the box with the plus sign in the fold margin, this will expand
that group.</font>
</li><li><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Click
on the box with the plus sign with the <span class="shortcut">Shift</span> or  <span class="shortcut">Ctrl</span> key pressed down. This
will expand the group and any folded subgroups.</font>
</li><li><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Using
the menu:<br></font><font face="Times New Roman, serif"><span class="menu_item">View-&gt;Unfold
All</span> will expand every single group in the document, this will cause
the maximum amount of text to be visible.</font>
<span class="menu_item">View-&gt;Uncollapse
current level</span> will only expand the current group (that is, the
group that contains the current line). This will not collapse any
subgroups.</font>
<span class="menu_item">View-&gt;Uncollapse
level...</span> will make every group of a certain level visible,
including any parenting group.</font>
</li></ul><font face="Times New Roman, serif">Also
note that if any change occurs in folded text, it will automatically
unfold to show the text.
