<h1>Tool Bar</h1>
<p>The
tool bar allows for quick access to certain menu commands (including
those of plugins if they are registered, see Plugins). If the screen
is smaller than the toolbar width, then some of its buttons will be
hidden. You can access these buttons by clicking on the chevron (the
double arrows) on the right of the toolbar, a menu will pop up
showing you the hidden commands.
You
can customize the toolbar to use different icons. Notepad++ supports
three modes:
<p><ul><li>
Standard icons: this is the default. These icons are
small and also include the plugin icons.
</li><li>Big
Icons: This shows larger icons, which can be changed into custom
icons. They have different images for highlighted or selected
buttons.
</li><li>Small
Icons: The same as big icons, but now with the size of the standard
toolbar icons.
</li></ul>
<p>To
choose which mode to use, see <a href="Preferences.html#Global">Preferences</a>.</font><p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">To
load custom images for your toolbar, you need a special configuration
file and the custom images. To learn how to use these, please see the
