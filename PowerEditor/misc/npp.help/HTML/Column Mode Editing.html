<h1>Column Mode editing</h1>

<p>A
special way of editing files is column mode editing. This means that
text can be selected in columns, rather than rows (effectively
meaning 'vertical editing'). The column editing support is done via
Scintilla, but with a few supplements of Notepad++. To initiate a
Column mode selection, depress the <span class="shortcut">Alt</span> key (default) when selecting
text (using <span class="shortcut">mouse</span> or <span class="shortcut">cursor keys</span>), moving the cursor downwards or
upwards as needed. This works best if a non-proportional (monospaced)
font is used, because then each character will be aligned with the
ones above and below it (refer to&nbsp;<a href="Styler%20Configurator.html">Styler Configurator</a> for more
information).
<p>When text is 
selected in this so called rectangilar mode, typing will change each selected column of characters into the typed character, or insert such a column.
Use the ESC key to exit this special typing mode. To back up one column, use the <span class="menu_item">Edit-&gt;Undo</span> feature, instead of the <span class="shortcut">Backspace</span> key.

<p>The
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Column Editor dialog</span> is designed to make working with columns easier.
It can be opened by selecting <span class="menu_item">Edit-&gt;Column Editor</span>.
<p>There
are two types of insertions that the column editor supports, regular
text or number sequences.
<ul><li> By selecting the <span class="radio">Text to insert</span> option, it
will overwrite each selected row with the given text. 
</li><li>The <span class="radio">Number to insert</span> option will change each selected row into a numeric value,
depending on the parameters given:
<ul><li>The <span class="label">Initial number</span> is the first
number to be inserted.
</li><li>The <span class="label">Increase by</span> value gives the value by which
each consecutive number will increase.
</li><li>If the <span class="radio">Leading zeros</span> option is
checked, smaller values will be padded with zeros to make them the
same size as larger values, character wise.
</li><li>Finally, you can choose
which radix to use for numbers (Format), default is Decimal (10 base).
