<h1>Feature Requests</h1>
<p>If
you have a (very) good idea on how to improve Notepad++, you can
request a feature using the Feature Request tracker
(<a target="_blank" href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker2/?group_id=95717&amp;atid=612385">https://sourceforge.net/tracker2/?group_id=95717&amp;atid=612385</a>).
If it hasn't been asked for before, you can do so here. There is no
guarantee it will be added however; what is a great feature for one
person might be a big nuisance for another, or it simply is too
difficult or time consuming to add it in. Also, some feature requests would involve modifying the Scintilla component, which would prove unpractical. In such a case, the feature request would be better filed with <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/scintilla/">the Scintilla project</a>
