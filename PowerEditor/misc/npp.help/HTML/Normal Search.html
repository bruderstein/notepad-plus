<h1>Normal search</h1>
<p>
<img style="width: 488px; height: 318px;" alt="" src="Images/Screenshots/find.png"><p>You
can search text as in most programs using the Find/Replace dialog.
You can open this dialog by selecting <span class="menu_item">Search-&gt;Find</span> (or pressing
<img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="Images/Toolbar/find.png">), <span class="menu_item">Search-&gt;Replace</span> (or pressing <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="Images/Toolbar/findReplace.png">) or <span class="menu_item">Search-&gt;Find in Files</span>.<p>
Each of these options will open the corresponding tab in the
Find/Replace dialog. This dialog will always stay on top of the text,
but you can still keep on editing the text if it's opened, and you
can set it to be transparent (using the Transparency option) when its
inactive (On lose focus) or at all times (Always). The slider
controls the amount of transparency. Note that transparency is only
available on Windows 2000 and later.
<p>In
the Find what field, type the text you want to find. This is
automatically filled with the current selected text, or the word under the caret, or the last searched pattern, when the Find
dialog is opened. The drop down list contains previous search items
if a search was performed before. See also Search Mode.
<p>
The
section below the Find what field allows you to mark and indicate all
hits for a certain search. 
<p><ul><li>
<span class="checkbox">Mark Line</span> adds a bookmark (see <a href="Bookmarks.html">Bookmarks</a>)
to the line with a hit
</li><li> <span class="checkbox">Style found token</span> will give the matching text
a different color (see <a href="Marking%20search%20results.html">Marking search results</a>)
 </li><li> <span class="checkbox">Purge for each search</span> will clear all bookmarks
and highlights before searching again.
</ul><p>
To
perform any of these actions, click the <span class="button">Find All </span>button in the section. To clear all
the results, click the <span class="button">Clear</span> button.
<p>
The <span class="checkbox">
In selection</span> checkbox will restrict search to the selection. It is disabled if there is no selection.
<p><ul><li><span class="checkbox">Match
whole word only</span> will only result in a hit if the match consists of an
entire word, not if it's partial (for example (but not limited to),
whitespace separated).
</li><li>
<span class="checkbox">Match
case</span> enforces that hits have exactly the same case as the query. If
this is disabled, the search is case insensitive.
</li><li>
<span class="checkbox">Wrap
around</span> will start at the top of the file when the end of the file is
reached when searching, depending on the location of the cursor.</li></ul>
<p>
The
search mode determines how the query will be handled:
<p><ul><li>In
<span class="radio">Normal</span>, the text will be searched literally. </li><li>In
<span class="radio">Extended</span>, special character sequences will be interpreted as special
characters such as newline characters. In this case, you can choose
from:
<ul><li><font face="Times New Roman, serif">\\
- Backslash character;</font>
</li><li><font face="Times New Roman, serif">\t
– TAB character;</font>
</li><li><font face="Times New Roman, serif">\r
– CR character;</font>
</li><li><font face="Times New Roman, serif">\n
– LF character;</font>
</li><li><font face="Times New Roman, serif">\0
– NULL character;</font>
</li><li><font face="Times New Roman, serif">\x##
- Hexadecimal value (between 00 and FF);</font>
</li><li><font face="Times New Roman, serif">\d###
- Decimal value (between 000 and 255);</font>
</li><li><font face="Times New Roman, serif">\o###
- Octal value (between 000 and 377);</font>
</li><li><font face="Times New Roman, serif">\b########
- Binary value (between 00000000 and 11111111).</font>
</li></ul>
</li><li>In
<span class="radio">Regular Expression</span>, the query will be handled like a regular
expression. Because Notepad++ makes use of the Scintilla regex
engine, it is the same as with SciTE, so a full list of regex options
can be found here (with the difference that POSIX mode is always on,
this is not an option): <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scintilla.org/SciTERegEx.html">http://www.scintilla.org/SciTERegEx.html</a>
with
some examples here:<a target="_blank" href="http://apps.sourceforge.net/mediawiki/notepad-plus/index.php?title=">Regular_Expressions</font></a>
</li></ul>
<p>The
search direction determines to what relative direction of the cursor
will be searched. <span class="radio">Up</span> means text before the cursor will be searched,
<span class="radio">Down</span> means text beyond the cursor will be searched.
<p>To
find the (next) hit, press <span class="button">Find Next</span> (or Enter). <span class="button">Count</span> will count the
amount of hits the search will result in. <span class="button">Find all in all opened
documents</span> will search all opened documents and displays a list of
results for each file, see also <a href="Searching%20in%20Files.html">Searching in Files</a>. <span class="button">Find all in current documents</span>
behaves in a very similar way.
<p><span class="button">Close</span>
simple closes the search dialog (close button and ESC do the same).</body></html>
