<h1>Menu</h1>
<p>The
main menu contains all the commands Notepad++ can offer (with the
exception of most of the Scintilla commands, which are accessible by
their shortcut keys, see&nbsp;<a href="Shortcut%20Mapper.html">Shortcut Mapper</a> for details). 
<p>
For
each item in the menu (with a few exceptions), there can be a
shortcutkey assigned. If this is the case, it will be shown next to
the name of the command. You can type this combination of keys
instead of selecting the command from the menu for quick access. To
change these shortcuts, simply use the <a href="Shortcut%20Mapper.html">Shortcut Mapper</a>
