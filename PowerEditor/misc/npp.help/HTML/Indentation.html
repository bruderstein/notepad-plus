<h1>Indentation</h1>
<p>
Indenting text is a common operation when
dealing with source code editing, and Scintilla and Notepad++ have
full support for it. Indentation is the addition of extra whitespace at
the start of a line to separate blocks of text, adding a hierarchy.
<p>
Normally when editing, pressing the <span class="shortcut">Tab</span>
key will insert a tab character
at the current location. However, if some text is selected, pressing
the <span class="shortcut">Tab</span> key
(by default) will add additional whitespace at the
beginning of each line that has any selected text, allowing to indent
entire blocks of text at once. Pressing <span class="shortcut">Shift-TAB</span> will remove the
indentation.
<p> Indentation is done in levels, each level adding a
predefined amount of whitespace (this amount can be configured, see <a href="Preferences.html#Edit_Components">Preferences</a>). There is also an option of choosing whether
to insert a TAB character or (multiple) spaces (for this, also see&nbsp;<a href="Preferences.html#Edit_Components">Preferences</a>).
<p>Scintilla can show a line/guide for each
level, which can be toggled by selecting <span class="menu_item">View-&gt;Show Symbol-&gt;Show Indent Guide</span>
or
pressing <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="Images/Toolbar/indentGuide.png">. This guideline shows a visual cue to keep track of the current indentation level of lines. To change the color used, see <a href="Styler%20Configurator.html#Indent_Guideline_Style">Styler Configurator</a> (note that if the guideline matches highlighted braces, it will assume the color of the brace highlight).
