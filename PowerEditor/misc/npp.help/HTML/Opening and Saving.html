<h1>Opening and Saving files:</h1>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Opening</span>
goes very similar to any other windows application. 
<p><ul><li>To open a file,
simply go to <span class="menu_item">File-&gt;Open</span> or press  <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="Images/Toolbar/openFile.png">. A dialog will appear and you
can select one or more files that have to be opened. Each file will
be opened in an individual tab. If the file was already opened,
Notepad++ will show you that file in its current state. In
the dialog, at the bottom there is a filter that will allow you to
only show the files that belong to a certain language (such as C++ or
PHP) depending on the extension. By default all files are shown.
</li><li>Another
way to open a file is to drag the file into Notepad++ using the
cursor. This can also be done with multiple files selected or whole folders.
</li><li>Additionally,
Notepad++ keeps a list of unopened, recently closed files in the File menu so
you can reopen them quickly. Simply click on the filename to open it
(see the section about Settings, Recent file list for more details).
To open all the files in that list, simply select <span class="menu_item">File-&gt;Open All
Recent Files</span> (selecting <span class="menu_item">File-&gt;Clean Recent Files List</span> will clear
that list).
</li><li>
See also the section about the <a href="Command%20Line.html">Command Line</a> to see how to open files
using the command line.
</li></ul>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Saving</span>
a file can be done in multiple ways.
<p>
<ul><li>The default way is to select
<span class="menu_item">File-&gt;Save</span> or press  <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="Images/Toolbar/saveFile.png">. If it is an existing file it will be
overwritten with the current contents. Note that if the file has not
been modified, you cannot save the file.
</li><li>If
you want to save all the files you have opened at once, you can
select <span class="menu_item">File-&gt;Save All</span> or press  <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="Images/Toolbar/saveAll.png">.
</li><li>If
the file has yet no name (for example, if you had created a new
file), or you selected <span class="menu_item">File-&gt;Save As</span>, the save file dialog will
pop up, asking you for the name of the file. You can then choose the
location and the name of the file.
</li><li>An useful variant  is <span class="menu_item">File-&gt;Save a Copy As</span>. The difference with <span class="menu_item">File-&gt;Save As</span> is that, after the latter, your work continues on the new file, while with the former it continues on the old file.
</li><li>The
filter at the bottom of the dialog can automatically add or change
the extension for you. Depending in the first extension listed for
that language, the filename will be changed to have that extension.</li></ul>
<p>You
can <span style="font-weight: bold;">Reload</span> a file if you wish to update the current view of the file
(for example, if the file has been modified) or restore its contents
to what is on disk if you have modified the file but not yet saved.
If the file has been changed on disk, by default Notepad++ will ask
you if you wish to reload it (see <a href="Preferences.html#MISC">Preferences</a> for more details).
<p>
You can do so by selecting <span class="menu_item">File-&gt;Reload from Disk</span>.
<p>
Finally,
you can choose to <span style="font-weight: bold;">Rename</span> a file by selecting <span class="menu_item">File-&gt;Rename</span>. A
dialog will pop up asking you for the new name of the file, similar
to the Save As dialog. However, the original file will be deleted.</body></html>
