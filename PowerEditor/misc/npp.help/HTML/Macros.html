<h1>Macros</h1>
<p>Notepad++
is capable of recording some of your actions you perform while
editing a document, and replaying those later on to avoid having to
repeat that sequence of actions. This is called a macro and can save
a great deal of time. Macro's can be played once, or multiple times,
even as long as is required to run through an entire document. You
can save them for later use and assign keystrokes to them for fast
access (See&nbsp;<a href="Shortcut%20Mapper.html">Shortcut Mapper</a>).</font>
Macro's
are sensitive to the current position of the cursor and will
(normally speaking) operate relative on it.
<p>To
<span style="font-weight: bold;">record</span> a macro, select <span class="menu_item">Macro-&gt;Start Recording</span> or press the&nbsp;<img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="Images/Toolbar/startRecord.png"> 
button on the toolbar. Notepad++ will now keep track of the changes
you make on a document or certain actions you perform.
<p>To
<span style="font-weight: bold;">stop recording</span>, select <span class="menu_item">Macro-&gt;Stop Recording</span> or select the&nbsp;<img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="Images/Toolbar/stopRecord.png">  button
on the toolbar. As an exception to most commands, you can toggle this
behavior with a special shortcut combination that is not listed in
the menu but solely in the Shortcut mapper (see Settings,
Shortcutmapper). By default, this is the combination <span class="shortcut">Ctrl-Shift-R</span>.
<p>After the recording is stopped, it will be stored in a temporary
buffer. If you haven't performed any actions, this buffer will be
cleared. If you start recording another macro without saving your earlier work, it will be lost.
<p>To
<span style="font-weight: bold;">play</span> the macro in the buffer, select <span class="menu_item">Macro-&gt;Playback</span> or press the&nbsp;<img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="Images/Toolbar/playRecord.png">
 button. This will perform the macro once at the current position.
<p><img style="width: 276px; height: 188px;" alt="" src="Images/Screenshots/save_shortcut.png"><p><font face="Times New Roman, serif">To
<span style="font-weight: bold;">save</span> the macro in the buffer, select <span class="menu_item">Macro-&gt;Save</span> current recorded
macro or press the&nbsp;<img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="Images/Toolbar/saveRecord.png">  button. A dialog will pop up asking for a name of
the macro and the default key combination. These can later be changed
(and deleted) using the Shortcutmapper (see <a href="Shortcut%20Mapper.html">Shortcut Mapper</a>). When saved, the macro will be available from the
Macro menu or the Macro playlist.
<p><img style="width: 258px; height: 201px;" alt="" src="Images/Screenshots/macro_multiple.png">
<p>To
<span style="font-weight: bold;">play</span> the current macro in the buffer or any saved macro once or
<span style="font-weight: bold;">multiple times</span>, select <span class="menu_item">Macro-&gt;Run a macro multiple times...</span> or press the <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="Images/Toolbar/playRecord_m.png">&nbsp;button. A
dialog will pop up allowing you to select what macro to perform
(buffer macro or any saved macro) and how many times. You can also
opt to perform the macro until the cursor reaches the end of the
current file (starting from its current position). Note that if no
macro's are available, this dialog is inaccessible.
<p>Currently
(v5.4.3), macro's cannot save Find(/Replace) operations.
