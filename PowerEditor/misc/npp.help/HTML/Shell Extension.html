<h1>Shell
Extension</h1>
<p>By default the Notepad++ installer comes with an Shell
extension. This is not really part of the Notepad++ program but very
useful. If you choose to install it, then any file you rightclick on
will show an entry named &#8220;Edit with Notepad++&#8221; with the Notepad++
icon.<p>
Please
note that to install or remove the extension, it sometimes is
required to restart the Explorer process. For this you can reboot,
logout and log back in or use the taskmanager to kill explorer
(Windows NT and up) and restart it again.  Hitting Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Del works too.
<p>If the Shell extension is
already installed, the Notepad++ installer cannot update or overwrite
it, you first have to uninstall it and restart Explorer.
