<h1>Windows
Dialog</h1>
<p>The
Window menu allows you to select a file from the list of the first 10
open documents in the active view (see also <a href="Multi%20View.html">Multi View</a>). Selecting a
document from the list will activate it.</font>
p><img alt="" src="Images/Screenshots/windows.png"><p>
You
can open the Windows dialog by selecting <span class="menu_item">Window-&gt;Windows...</span>. The
Windows dialog allows you to manage all the currently open documents
of the activate view.
<p>
The
Windows dialog shows a list of all the open documents in the active
view. You can select one or more documents from the list. Like any
Windows list control, select multiple by dragging during clicking
with your mouse, or by pressing <span class="shortcut">Ctrl</span> or <span class="shortcut">Shift</span> when selecting by
<span class="shortcut">clicking</span>. Or use the <span class="shortcut">arrow keys</span> on your keyboard optionally with the
<span class="shortcut">Ctrl</span> or <span class="shortcut">Shift</span> key depressed (if you do so, use the <span class="shortcut">spacebar</span> key to
select).
<p>
Selecting
one allows you to activate it by clicking on the <span class="button">Activate</span> button.
This will close the dialog.
<p>
Selecting
one or more allows you to click on the <span class="button">Save</span> button, this will perform
the Save operation if possible on all selected documents (if a Save
As.. operation is needed, nothing will happen (see File Management,
Opening and Saving)).
<p>
Selecting
one or more also allows you to close those documents by clicking on <span class="button">Close Window(s)</span>. If a document
contains any changes, you will be asked if you want to save them.
<p>
To
sort the documents using the dialog, first sort the list by selecting
one of the column titles in the top (selecting twice inverts the sort
order). After doing so, select <span class="button">Sort Tabs</span> to sort them, the documents
will be rearranged in the view.
<p>
Click
<span class="button">OK</span> to close the dialog.
