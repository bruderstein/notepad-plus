<h1>Plugins
</h1><p>
Notepad++
is very extensible using so called plugins. Plugins are small or big
additions to Notpead++ to enhance its functionality. Notepad++ comes
bundled with a few plugins (when using the installer, you
can choose which ones to add), but you can always add your own or
remove some. The plugins are located in the Plugins directory in the
main Notepad++ installation directory. They are DLL files and simply
removing or adding them is enough.
<p>
Be
careful to make sure your version of Notepad++ is up-to-date enough
for new plugins and that the plugin is compatible with Notepad++
(some very old plugins will not work with newer versions of
Notepad++, it is up to the developer of the plugin to add support or
not).
<p>
Currently,
Notepad++ can be found in an (older) ANSI version and the newer
Unicode verison. The plugin has to match this version, otherwise it
will not work (Notepad++ will warn you about this).</font>
Plugins
can be found anywhere on the internet, but the “official”collection
can be found in the Notepad++ Plugins project on SourceForge.net:</font>
