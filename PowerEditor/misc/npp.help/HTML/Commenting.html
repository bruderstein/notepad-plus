<h1>Commenting</h1>
<p>When
programming, it is often useful to comment (adding certain tags
around or in front of text to mark it is non-code) or uncomment
(large) section of text. Notepad++ allows to add two types of
comments:
<br><ul><li>block
comments, which means adding a special tag in front of each line of
(selected) text.
</li><li>stream
comments, which means putting special tags around the selected text.</li></ul>
<p>
Notepad++
can also remove block comments from text, or toggle them (adding them
where absent and removing them where present). These options are
available from the <span class="menu_item">Edit</span> menu or the Context Menu (see the section
about the <a href="Context%20Menu.html">Context Menu</a> for more details).<p>
<ul><li>
To add block comment tags, select <span class="menu_item">Edit-&gt;Comment/Uncomment-&gt;Block comment</span>.
</li><li> To remove block comment tags, select <span class="menu_item">Edit-&gt;Comment/Uncomment-&gt;Block uncomment</span>.
</li><li> To Toggle tags for all selected lines, select <span class="menu_item">Edit-&gt;Comment/Uncomment-&gt;Block toggle comment</span/li><li>To add stream comment tags around the selected text, select <span class="menu_item">Edit-&gt;Comment/Uncomment-&gt;Stream comment</span>.</ul>
p>Note that if a block comment starts in column 1, and you toggle block 
comment on a range of lines that contains the line, the line will be 
uncommented, which is not usually desired. This behaviour is difficult to 
avoid.
