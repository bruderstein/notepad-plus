<h1>Closing
files</h1><p>
In
order to close the files you have open, you have multiple options at
hand. Remember that if you have any unsaved data in a file, Notepad++
will always ask you if you'd like to save those changes before
closing any file.
<p>Primarily,
you can close any file by selecting <span class="menu_item">File-&gt;Close</span> or press <img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="Images/Toolbar/closeFile.png">. 
<p>To
close all files, select <span class="menu_item">File-&gt;Close All</span> or press&nbsp;<img style="width: 16px; height: 16px;" alt="" src="Images/Toolbar/closeAll.png">. 
<p>To close all
the files but the active one, select <span class="menu_item">File-&gt;Close All but Active</span>.
<p>You
can also close any tab by clicking on it with the middle mouse
button. This way you can close tabs without having to bring them to
the foreground. A right click on the tab will invoke a context menu, from which the topmost entry is <span class="menu_item">Close me</span>. That works just as well if you have only two mouse buttons.</font>
<p>There
is also a setting that allows you to close any tab by doubleclicking
on it, or show a close button on each tab (<img style="width: 11px; height: 11px;" alt="" src="Images/closeTabButton.png">). To see how to do this,
see the section about configuring the Tab Bar in the <a href="Preferences.html#Global">Preference dialog</a>
<p>Finally,
you can close any active tab by clicking on the cross in the
top-right corner of the menu bar.
