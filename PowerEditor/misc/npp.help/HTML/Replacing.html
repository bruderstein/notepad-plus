<h1>Replacing</h1>
<p>
<img style="width: 488px; height: 318px;" alt="" src="Images/Screenshots/replace.png"><p>The
Replace dialog is a supplement to the Find dialog. All the same rules
still apply, but now you can replace the found text with some other
text., or nothing if you want to remove it.
<p>
The
most important change is that the <span class="checkbox">Selection only</span> checkbox now applies
to the Replace All operation. <span class="button">Replace All</span> will replace all
occurrences of the query with the replacement text. <span class="button">Replace in all
opened documents</span> will perform a Replace All operation on all the
documents that are currently opened in Notepad++. Likewise, <span class="button">Replace in files</span> performs a replacement across all files of a certain type(s) in a folder; it is available from the Find in files dialog, and uses all its applicable options.
