<h1>Switching
between Documents</h1>
<p>For
switching between documents the foremost method is by using the tab
bar. However, you can also use the keyboard or mouse to do so. By
default, you can switch to the next document by depressing the <span class="shortcut">Ctrl</span>
key and then pressing <span class="shortcut">Tab</span> once for each next document. Pressing <span class="shortcut">shift</span>
as well will select the previous document. To use the mouse, depress
the <span class="shortcut">right mouse button</span> and use the <span class="shortcut">scroll wheel</span>. <span class="shortcut">Scrolling up</span> will
select the previous document, <span class="shortcut">scrolling down</span> the next. The order of the
documents is derived from the tab bar. See <a href="Tab%20Bar.html">Tab Bar</a> or <a href="Windows%20Dialog.html">Windows Dialog</a>
for information on how to change it.<p>
Documents
will by default be cyclically selected, meaning that if you select
the document past the last one, the first will be selected. If two
views are visible, the first document of the other view will be
selected.<p>
Selecting
the document previous to the first document will select the last
document (if two views are visible that will be the last document of
the other view).<p>
