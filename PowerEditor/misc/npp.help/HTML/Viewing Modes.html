<h1>Viewing Modes</h1>
<p>
Notepad++ is a Windows application, and thus can be maximised, restored or minimised (to the system tray) as such. It has two extra ways to use as much screen real estate as possible.<p>
Using <span class="menu_item">View-&gt;Toggle Full Screen Mode</span>, the title, menu and status bar, as well as the toolbar, are hidden, and the text can occupy an extra portion of the screen, with the tab bar still visible at the top. Using <span class="menu_item">View-&gt;PostIt</span>,  also a toggle, replaces that tab bar by an horizontal gap. So,what could happen enabling both? the tab bar disappears and the text ca be displayed on the full monitor height.
<p>Combined with <span class="menu_item">View-&gt;Always on Top</span>, they contribute to make text as easy and flexibly visible as one could wish.
