<h1>MRU
(Most Recently Used) switching</h1>
<p>Notepad++
can provide MRU behavior for switching between files. MRU stands for
Most Recently Used and means that the first file to be activated, is
the last one active before the current document. This will put often
used files to the top and less used files to the bottom (If you are
familiar with the Windows Task Switcher, the behavior is similar).
MRU is only available when the Document Switcher is enabled.
