<h1>Shortcut Mapper</font>
</h1><p>The
Shortcut Mapper controls the keyboard shortcuts assigned to
commands from the menus and the Scintilla control. Pressing such a
shortcut will trigger the command. Menu shortcuts have a one-to-one
mapping, meaning that a menu item can have only one shortcut, and no
duplicate shortcuts are allowed (you can enter them, but only one
will work, so be careful with conflicts). Scintilla shortcuts have a
one-to-many mapping, meaning a single Scintilla command can be
triggered by multiple shortcut combinations. However, the same
shortcut for multiple commands is not allowed, just as with the menu.<p><img style="width: 593px; height: 584px;" alt="" src="Images/Screenshots/shortcut_mapper.png"><p>
Shortcuts
are listed in a two column list. The left column shows the name of
the command, the right column the associated shortcut, if any.</font>
When
viewing shortcuts, <span class="shortcut">doubleclicking</span> on it or <span class="shortcut">rightclicking</span> and
selecting <span class="menu_item">Modify</span> allows you to change it. You will get an dialog with
the name (modifiable for macros and run commands) and the assigned
shortcut. Use the checkboxes to control what modifier keys to use (note that Scintilla does not support the <span class="shortcut">Windows key</span>, as it hardly makes sense on a Unix/Mac machine) and
the dropdownlist to choose the key to press. Selecting 'none' from
the list will disable the shortcut key (a warning will appear).
Pressing <span class="button">OK</span> applies any changes, <span class="button">Cancel</span> or closing the dialog aborts.

The
dialog for Scintilla shortcuts is a bit different because you can add
multiple shortcuts. In addition to the normal controls, you will find
a listbox with all the assigned shortcuts (if any). The <span class="button">Add</span> button
will add the current entered shortcut if not 'None' and not already
in the list. The <span class="button">Remove</span> button will remove the selected shortcut from
the list (you can remove all but the last).
<p>The
<span class="button">Apply</span> button will change the currently selected shortcut to the
current settings. To
remove a shortcut if more than one is present, use the Remove button.
To remove a shortcut if it is the only one, set it to 'None' and
Apply<p>
The
<span class="button">OK</span> button will save any added or changed shortcuts, but you have to
specifically perform the change before it is saved.</font>
>p>In
all cases, if a shortcut is determined to be invalid, you cannot
press OK or Apply to add or modify the shortcut.</font>
<p>

The
shortcuts are divided in multiple categories:
<p><dl>
<dt>Main Menu:
<dd>These
shortcuts control the default main menu commands. Additionally you
can change the shortcut for switching between documents, but this is
not recommended (there are still issues with this if you use some
other modifier than the Ctrl key).
<dt>Macros:
<dd>Shortcuts
for recorded and saved macros. You can edit the name of the macro as
well. You can also delete Macros from here by <span class="shortcut">rightclicking</span> on the
macro and selecting delete.
<dt>Run commands:
<dd>Shortcuts
for saved commands. You can edit the name of the command as well. You
can also delete Run commands from here by <span class="shortcut">rightclicking</span> on the
command and selecting delete.
<dt>Plugin commands:
<dd>Shortcuts
for plugins. By default a plugin can opt for a shortcut combination
but you can manually add or override it here. See also
<a href="Plugins.html">Plugins</a>
<dt>Scintilla commands:
<dd>Shortcuts
for Scintilla. Only the primary shortcut is displayed in the list,
but when editing the command all of them will be listed.
