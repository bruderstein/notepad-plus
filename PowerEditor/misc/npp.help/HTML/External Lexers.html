<body><h1>External Lexers</h1><p>External
lexers are like built-in languages, but are provided by means of a
plugin (see <a href="Plugins.html">Plugins</a> for details). This allows to user to add powerful
syntax coloring and folding, but are harder to make. Installation goes
the same as for regular plugins, and you can select them from the
<span class="menu_item">Languages</span> menu, they will be at the bottom.</body></html>
